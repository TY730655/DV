
Goodnight is mainly composed of three visualizations.
They are sunburst chart, bar chart and line chart.

=============== Sunburst chart====================

Sunburst colors are differentiated by gender.(Blue represents Male, red represents Female)
The sunburst chart consists of four layers namely Gender, Smoking Status, Exercise Frequency, and Alcohol Consumption arranged from innermost to outermost.

When you hover over a specific section,it will show the name and the count of that section.
After clicking on a section of the sunburst chart,you can dynamically zoom in or out of the chart.
The upper left corner of the chart will simultaneously display information about the level of the clicked section.


=============== Bar chart====================

We can either click on the sections of the sunburst chart or use the checkboxes on the right to view the average sleep efficiency under different conditions.
Check the data names you want to analyze.
The X-axis labels will change based on the data you've checked.
The names will be in order according to the checkbox.

When the Gender field is checked, it will display blue or red based on gender.
If the Gender field is not checked, it will display purple.

=============== Line chart====================

Based on the line chart, we can understand the distribution of individual bedtimes and wakeup times.
The values between bedtime and wake-up times in the line indicate the sleep duration.
According to the general belief that 80% sleep efficiency represents good sleep,the line color is divided into colors.
If the line is red,it means that the person's sleep may be a little problematic.
Through the average sleep time, we can know that in which month do people tend to sleep later and wake up later.


=============== Interact with each other====================

When you click on the sunburst chart, you can view the average sleep efficiency under different conditions from the bar chart.
The line chart will not only highlight the bed and wake-up times meeting the conditions 
but also show significant differences in average sleep and wake-up times across various demographic groups.
You can click on the dropdown menu to choose the age range of data to be displayed in Goodnight,analyzing multi-faceted information across different age groups.
We can understand the impact of different gender and lifestyle habits on sleep in various age groups.
